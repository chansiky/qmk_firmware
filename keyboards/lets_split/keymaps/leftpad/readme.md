# leftpad

## philosophy

The philosophy behind the leftpad configuration is to have all symbols
available on the left side of the split keyboard so that a user using a mouse
or a pen-tablet will have access to all numbers and symbols without taking
their hand off the mouse/tablet.

This allows users to access any keyboard shortcut using only their left hand if
they are in a program like photoshop or 3DS-Max.
